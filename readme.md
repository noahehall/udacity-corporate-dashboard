# Why are we here?
  - Udacity Project #4 - corporate dashboard

# Requirements
You must develop a corporate dashboard application using a front-end MVC framework of your choosing. The dashboard application must contain a header (with the currently selected dashboard’s name); a menu, allowing the user to navigate between dashboards; and the primary dashboard display area. You should find, or create, your own data files in CSV and JSON formats to provide data to the dashboards. The required dashboards are:

1. A geospatial view, identifying the number of employees at various company locations.
2. A “key metrics” view, containing components displaying: the number of open issues, a line chart reflecting number of paying customers over a period of time, and a bar chart reflecting number of reported issues over a period of time.
3. A “data view” of all issues, with an appearance similar to a spreadsheet, that is sortable and filterable. An issue should contain the following fields:
  1. submission timestamp
  2. customer name
  3. customer email address
  4. description
  5. open/closed status
  6. closed timestamp
  7. employee name
